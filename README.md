# Ansers

Github repository for the Ansers web application.

## Available Scripts

Additionally to the scripts from create react, there are `:local` options, which will then use a fake backend to showcase changes (E.g. on github pages).

These are:

* `build:local` - Create a release build with dummy backend
* `start:local` - Start the testing server with dummy backend
